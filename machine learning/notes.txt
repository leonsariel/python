SVM

1. loss function:
	function to test if the model is fit the actual return properly.
	eg. L(Y, f(x)) = (Y - f(x))^2
	we expect the loss function return a smaller number( means better fit)

2. risk function:
	is the expectation of loss function:
	need to minimize the average of all loss function returns
	eg.  avg(L(Yi, f(xi)))
